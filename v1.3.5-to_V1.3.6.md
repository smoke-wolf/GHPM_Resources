## Issues and Solutions for Version 1.3.5 to 1.3.6

### Settings Issue #BFPER

The GUI implementation of the settings did not load correctly.

### DisplayEvents Issue #PNCFM

Display events were fixed to True, but the toggle switch did not work.

**Patch:**
Fixed an arbitrary boolean of DisplayEvents to False.

### ChangeUsername Issue #CBQPK

The change password feature did not implement the new password to the UserProfile.

**Patch:**
Dependent implementation of 'os.getcwd()' was replaced with User.UserProfile.SourceDirectory.

### Critical Launch Issue #FMGHH

The user could log in even if the password was entered incorrectly. However, if the password was entered incorrectly and then correctly, the GUI failed to launch.

**Description:**
If the password was entered correctly the first time, the GUI launched without issue. If the password was entered incorrectly and then correctly, the GUI failed.

**Original code:**

    def check_password(password): 
	    try: 
		    import System.Drive.Password as ps
		    ps.Password(Event='Login', Input=password) 	
		    print('Logged In Successfully!')  
		    return True  
		except: 	
			sys.exit(0)

**Patched code:**

    def check_password(password):
	    try: 
		    import System.Drive.Password as ps 	
		    ps.Password(Event='Login', Input=password) 
		    print('Logged In Successfully!') 
		    return True  
		except: 
			print('Invalid Password') 
			return False


### Systemic Installer Issue #SBDSS

An installer error occurred after extensive use of the package.

**Patch:**
When installing, the program would `os.chdir` into the installed application, thus making any more `os.getcwd()` calls incorrect in regards to the current location. Dependent implementation of 'os.getcwd()' was replaced with User.UserProfile.SourceDirectory.

### Uninstaller Issue #CRKAJ

The uninstaller failed to remove the directory, but successfully removed the address within Int.txt.

**Patch:**
Dependent implementation of 'os.getcwd()' was replaced with User.UserProfile.SourceDirectory.

### Activator Error Issue #CHBEJ

When activating, the program would `os.chdir` into the activated application, thus making any more `os.getcwd()` calls incorrect in regards to the current location.

**Patch:**
Dependent implementation of 'os.getcwd()' was replaced with User.UserProfile.SourceDirectory.
